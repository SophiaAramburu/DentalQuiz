# DentalQuiz

## My Goal 
My primary goal for this assignment was to use my newly found JavaScript skills to create a quiz about whatever topic I desired. I chose to create a quiz about teeth since I work at a Dentist office. I had a good time but a hard time making this. It really put my patience to the test. I realize after making this project that I still need to practice my basic JavaScript skills. My secondary goals were to make a timer on the quiz that went down from a minute to zero. My future goal is to go back in and be able to figure out how to make the timer go down when the user answers the question incorrectly and insert code to save the initials and score of the user who takes the quiz. 

### Buiding a Responsive Quiz
-I was assigned to create a responsive quiz about whatever topic I choose using JavaScript. That included making the HTML and CSS so that It had the correct skeleton and looked appealing to the eye while being responsive in doing everything I wanted the quiz to do. The first step I took was to create a strong HTML. Second, I made sure to use proper use of semantic html. I linked my Javascript and CSS inside of the HTML to ensure that it functioned correctly. 

-I then created the JavaScript code, and that is what took me the longest. Figuring out how to make the timer was an eye opener for me. I added accessibility comments so that I wouldn't get confused with what each line of code was for, which i've noticed can happen fairly easily with JavaScript.

-Lastly, I made the CSS to create a page that was easy to look at. I had a lot of fun with this part but I made sure that I didn't take up too much time doing so, so that I could try to work on the JavaScript acceptance criteria that I hadn't figured out yet. I also added hover effects that I feel pretty confident using after I submitted my last assignment- the Portolio. I've messed around a lot with the different effects. I added background color hover effects to a few of my flexbox's.
